# this repo demos

* writing a simple http web server from scratch.
* rust threading with Arc & Mutex
* tcp stream with rust
* use src/common.rs as third lib instead of module








To build this, please see either https://www.rustup.rs/ or https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html for installation of the Rust compiler (multiplatform).

To build the source code, use;
cargo build --all --release
The binaries will be located in ./target/release, web_server, and game_server. The index.html and game.html will need to be copied to the same location.

Alternatively run;
cargo run --bin web_server & cargo run --bin game_server

The web_server requires the game_server to be running, and connects to it on port 3001

*Notes*

The cpu only iterates through the available moves and inserts the first valid one, I felt this was sufficient for demonstration. The logic is performed on the game server.

There is no End Game or Scores displayed - This would be easy enough to add via the tictac_handler or by adding extra data in communication between the web_server and game_server. Again, I felt what is done is sufficient for demonstration (this was a lot of work! :) ).
Ideally I would add an extra field to the JSON sent from the game_server that contains "winner:none||X||O", and the web_server would read this and display the appropiate page.

Why did I use Rust?

- It is the language I am most comfortable in, much more so than Python, Java (especially!), Haskell (it borrows some Haskell style idioms though), or even C/C++.

- It has excellent memory safety properties, the compiler makes it almost impossible to do such things as "free after use", and as a result it also has excellent (safe) concurrency capabilities.

- The return an Option or Result paradigm makes many things trivial to implement, such as;
    let web_address = match args.nth(1) {
        Some(s) => s,
        None => {
            println!("Started on localhost:3000");
            "localhost:3000".to_string()
        }
    };
This matches a pattern (on the left of => ), in this case, if the user provided an argument to web_server (eg, web_server localhost:666), then that would be contained in the "Option" returned from .nth(), a function that returns either Some(T) or None depending on if that index exists or not.
Makes it completely safe! No out of bounds etc.
In the above example, Option is an enum, defined as;
    pub enum Option<T> {
        None,
        Some(T),
    }
where T is some type.

- It is also fast, I like fast.
